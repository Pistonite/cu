//! Batteries-included common utils
//!
//! (If you are viewing this on docs.rs, please use the [self-hosted
//! version](https://cu.pistonite.dev) instead)
//!
//! # Install
//! Since crates.io does not have namespaces, this crate has a prefix.
//! You should manually rename it to `cu`, as that's what the proc-macros
//! expect.
//! ```toml
//! # Cargo.toml
//! # ...
//! [dependencies.cu]
//! package = "pistonite-cu"
//! version = "..." # check by running `cargo info pistonite-cu`
//! features = [ "full" ] # see docs
//!
//! # ...
//! [dependencies]
//! ```
//!
//! # General Principal
//! `cu` tries to be as short as possible with imports. Common and misc
//! utilities are exported directly by the crate and should be used
//! as `cu::xxx` directly. Sub-functionalities are bundled when makes
//! sense, and should be called from submodules directly, like `cu::fs::xxx`
//! or `cu::co::xxx`. The submodules are usually 2-4 characters.
//!
//! The only time to use `use` to import from `cu`, is with the prelude module
//! `pre`:
//! ```rust
//! # use pistonite_cu as cu;
//! use cu::pre::*;
//! ```
//! This imports traits like [`Context`] and [`PathExtension`] into scope.
//!
//! # Feature Reference:
//! - `cli`, `print`, `prompt`:
//!   See [`cli`](module@cli). Note that logging is still available without any feature flag.
//! - `coroutine` and `coroutine-heavy`:
//!   Enables `async` and integration with `tokio`. See [`cu::co`](module@co).
//! - `fs`: Enables file system utils. See [`cu::fs`](module@fs) and [`cu::bin`](module@bin).
//! - `process`: Enables utils spawning child process. See [`Command`].
//! - `parse`, `json`, `yaml`, `toml`:
//!   Enable parsing utilities, and additional support for common formats. See
//!   [`Parse`](trait@Parse).
